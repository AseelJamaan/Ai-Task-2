## Image Recognition Model using Teachable Machine by Google
### Project Overview
This project involves training an image recognition model using Teachable Machine by Google. The model classifies images into at least two distinct classes ( flower/ tree ). The trained model is then exported in TensorFlow format. A Python script is created to load the model, accept an input image, and predict the class of the image.

### Steps Taken
- Training the Model:
I used Teachable Machine to train an image recognition model.
The model was trained with at least two classes for image classification.

- Exporting the Model:
The trained model was exported in TensorFlow format for further use in a Python script.

- Python Script:
A Python script was written to:

 Load the exported model.

 Accept an image input.
 
 Predict the class of the input image using the trained model.
